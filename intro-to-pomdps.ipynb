    "- In an MDP, the states are completely observable\n",
    "    - At any point in time, we know the current state with 100% accuracy\n",
    "- In a POMDP, the states are partially observable\n",
    "    - We have an additional tool, \"observations,\" to provide evidence as to the possible current state\n",
    "        - I suppose we would call these \"emissions\" in the HMM\n",
    "    - We have to maintain a probability distribution over possible states (like in an HMM)\n",
